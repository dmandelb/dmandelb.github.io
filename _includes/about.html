                <p>
                  Problem solving, debugging, and mathematical thinking are all skills that inform my work as a Web Developer. As a life long learner, learning new languages and technologies is a priority. As a collaborator, addressing challenges while keeping work fun for myself and colleagues is critical. With previous management experience, I have gained the ability to work well with a wide variety of personality types. I value working in diverse environments with a close-knit team.
