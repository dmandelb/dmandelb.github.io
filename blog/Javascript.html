      Well we've been writing some code for a little while now, we've all written a few loops by now, yes? If you're reading this, you may not be doing the same things I am, so I'll give you a little refresher of looping in Ruby, because that's what I've been doing up until now. 
    </p>
    <p>
      So we're in Ruby. We want to loop a thing. And by this I mean we want to do a thing a certain number of times, based on a condition. A nice simple, straightforward way of doing this is to establish a counter variable (which we will conveniently name "counter" instead of "x" because descriptive variables are better for programming than math variables, I keep reminding myself). Some people like to use UNLESS loops. I myself find that the mental grammar that goes along with that gets a little confusing, so unless I have to, I'd rather not. (See what I did there?) I prefer WHILE loops. That might look a little something like this:
      <pre><code>
        counter = 0
        while counter < 42
          p "What do you get when you multiply six by nine?"
          counter = counter + 1
        end
      </code></pre>
      And what we've got there is...going to be an exceedingly long output, but it's accurate code, and I like references, so I don't know what to tell you. Don't run that unless you want that string printed out 42 times. So what we've got there is in the first line we're declaring our counting variable, in the second line we're setting the condition upon which our code will stop looping. (If you never meet that condition, your code will loop forever, or at least until your computer gets sick of your BS and shuts it down.) The third and fourth lines are what are considered inside our loop, and the fifth line is the end of the loop, at which point it will check the beginning of the loop again to see if the condition still evaluates to true. If nothing ever happens inside the loop to alter part of the condition, it will never change, and your computer will definitely lose patience with you. Therefore, in line four, we increment counter up by one. (There are shortcuts for doing this, like counter +=1 and counter ++, but this is the purest form for showing what is happening.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we're going to go to JavaScript. We want to loop the same thing the same number of times. So what is that going to look like?
      <pre><code>
        while (var counter = 0; counter < 42; counter ++) {
          console.log("What do you get when you multiply six by nine?")
        };
      </code></pre>
      I'll just start in the middle, because starting at the beginning is for people who work in order. The contents of the loop are the same. console.log is the approximate JavaScript equivalent to p in Ruby. The big difference between JavaScript and Ruby in loops is the housekeeping. In Ruby, if you're going to use a counting variable, you have to declare it before your loop even begins, and then you have to increment it up inside your loop. When I first learned that, it all made perfect sequential sense. However, this is probably the thing I like best about Javascript. It lets you declare your counting variable, define your condition, and describe how you want your counting variable incremented all before your actual looping code even begins. It's just so neat and tidy, I love it. Now, full disclosure, if you were to decide you wanted your loop to end on a variable holding a boolean value, this form wouldn't help you much, and you'd have to put any code that might do that into your loop anyway. But I'm a math guy, and I like my counting variables, so this is appealing to me.
