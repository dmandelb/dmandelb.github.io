      Arrays and hashes are two ways of storing informaion in ordered lists in Ruby. It's important to note that hashes only became ordered in more recent versions of Ruby, but it's only important for reference. Order is much more important to the basis of arrays.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an array, the order is built into the list, and any piece of information stored in it will correspond to an integer between 0 and a number n-1, where n is the number of elements (or pieces of information) the array can store (they are highly variable in size). In a hash, however, the order is built solely on the order in which elements are put into it. No content of the hash establishes or maintains the order of its elements. Hashes store their elements in pairs, the first element of the pair called the key, and the second called the value. The keys in a hash correspond to the integers that an array is built upon, in that they are the information one would use to call out the corresponding element. In a sense, arrays can be seen as a subset of hashes, in which the keys must be consecutive integers. If you were to write a hash with consecutive integers as keys, in order, it would behave in much the same way as an array. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When building a hash, all of the keys must be distinctive from one another, while the values for different keys can be identical. It is, in fact, the same with arrays, except since the keys of an array are automatically built by ruby, you'll never encounter the opportunity to do so. The reason for this is that the keys are used to retrieve the values. If you have two keys that are identical, it would be impossible for your computer to know which one you wanted. 
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the best uses for hashes is when you want to associate a set of informational elements with something non-numerical, like strings with strings. The example given in The Well-Grounded Rubyist by David Black is state names with their abbreviations, with the names as the keys and their abbreviations as the values. Given how odd some state abbreviations are (especially some of the ones starting with M), you can imagine how it might be useful to have something like this to look up! You can also imagine that while it's possible it might be useful to have a database like this in some sort of order, it's certainly not the defining priority. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Much more important to the nature of hashes is the relationship between the keys and the values. While in arrays, the order can prove extremely useful, and in fact integral to the structure the elements are put into an array, hashes can be later rearranged to fit whatever order is needed, and the most important relationship when building a hash is the relationship between the keys and the values.
