	It felt fantastic to take what I've been learning (and what I had previously already known) about HTML and use it to actually build a working site that actually exists on the internet. It'll be even more exciting when it looks fancier though. 
	At first, the semantic HTML5 elements didn't make a lot of sense to me, but the more I read, the more I understood what they were for, the more I wanted to make use of them. 
	I didn't really have a hard time keeping away from formatting in the HTML and such things, because I actively avoided learning too much about how to do it. Aside from that, I just kind of told myself that HTML is for content, and I'll worry later about making it look pretty.
	I like HTML so far, I feel limited, but I'm expecting that as I learn more, I'll feel less limited. I also expect that I'll feel less limited as I learn CSS.
	My biggest focus in writing HTML properly so far is making sure to remember the closing tags, and closing them in the right order. I've been repeating "Don't cross the streams" to myself in regards to closing tags in the right order, and I've had a little experience with it in an old blogging platform I used to use called Kiwibox, so I feel pretty good about it so far.
