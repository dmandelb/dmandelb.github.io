	<!--
	It was all a pretty simple process. Both of us wanted a fairly basic blog layout, so our wireframe ideas were pretty much on par with each other.
	Wireframing has not been tremendously effective for my process thus far, but I also have not had a great deal of inspiration for my site. I've been pretty tame so far, so there hasn't been much to wireframe. Maybe when we add the About Me section it'll prove a little more interesting.
	Sharon and I decided that simplicity was the best plan for now, so we made sure all of the relevant information was there, and organized, and left it at that.
