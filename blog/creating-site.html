      There is an inherent self-centered aspect of building a website centered around yourself, and of this entire project, that has been what I've struggled with the most. Immediately when I found out I would be writing a blog, I knew what I wanted it to look like, generally speaking, and I had no trouble implementing it. The part of the site that was supposed to be about me, however, I felt a lot less comfortable with, and much much less inspired by. I felt very ambivalent about the design, and even more ambivalent about the content. If it had not been quite so structured, I think the part of my website that was supposed to be about me would have more become about an aggregate of my interests.

      I have had several blogs over the course of my internet life, on various blogging platforms, and only once has it truly been about me. While I'm not uncomfortable talking about myself, I don't have a particular need to broadcast my life either, which is what publishing something about myself feels like. I'm much more comfortable generating content about other things. On here, I have written about topics I've been learning about in coding, which has flowed naturally. On another blog, I have tended to write most about pop culture and my favorite shows, books, and other media when writing is what I do. Not since high school have I made something so relentlessly about myself as the other half of this website has been, and in my mind, the aesthetic difference is symbolic of a wider divide.

      When I think about this site, I think of it as two sites, my technical blog, and my home page. While my technical blog is inarguably a simpler layout, and I have therefore put more time and effort into my home page, I have felt much more personally invested in getting the look of my blog just the way I want it. There have been aspects of my home page that I really wanted to get right, but that was more about figuring out the CSS than getting it to look the way I wanted. The whole way, my inspiration was here. I remember the first computer I ever used, or at least I think I do, one in which I very carefully inserted 5 1/4" floppy disks (the last true floppies) and used DOS prompts to play Fisher Price games. I immediately wanted a look that was reminiscent of that interface, both in font and color, and set about implementing that. I had much less of a concrete idea for my home page, and I think that shows. I more or less created it on the fly, making decisions because a decision had to be made at a given time. That half was a labor of necessity. This half was a labor of love. The exception, I suppose, was my game, which, when I uploaded it, was completely a labor of love.
