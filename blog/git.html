      Okay, so you're playing a video game. You've got all these skill points and all this awesome gear, and you're going along, doing what you do. But somewhere along the line, you're not sure where, something goes wrong, and everything comes crumbling down around you. But it's okay, right? You've got a save point. You can just pick up from there and try again. Now imagine you could do that when writing code. That's what Version Control does, but it's only the start. If you've got a bunch of people working on something, like say you're all playing a sports video game, Version Control can also act as the scorecard, keeping track of who did what and when, so if you need to, you can go back and refer to it, and do a little analysis and make some adjustments.

       Git in particular keeps a log on your computer of everything you've done on a project in the directory (folder) where you keep your work. In addition, at the remote storage site, GitHub, it keeps the same running log of your contributions, along with all of the contributions made by anyone else working on your project.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even better, GitHub has a feature called Merge that it uses to preserve all of the contributed work. Imagine for a moment that you and your partner each took a copy of the project that was stored somewhere remotely. You each worked on separate parts, but you finished first, and uploaded your new version, overwriting what was uploaded before. Then, the next day, your partner uploads theirs, complete with the section of theirs that existed before you changed anything, overwriting what you uploaded. If only there was some way to fix that, right? Well I've got good news for you. Merge looks at the entirety of each version of a project, and specifically looks at what was changed by the user uploading it. If none of what they worked on was changed between the last time they checked in and their upload, GitHub merges it without a problem. If there is a conflict, it raises an alert, so the conflict can be resolved. There is even an additional safety feature called a Pull Request that can be used to have a third party verify that all conflicts are resolved well and that everything works well together.
